    "\n",
    "This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention**\n",
    "- An order might have multiple items.\n",
    "- Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.\n",
    "- All text identifying stores and partners were replaced by the names of Game of Thrones for data privacy .\n",

    "|---|---:|---|---|\n",
    "| `olist_customers_dataset` | 99,441 | `customer_id` | One row per customer. Contains a unique row-level **customer ID**, a persistent customer unique ID (to track returning customers), ZIP code prefix, city and state. |\n",
    "| `olist_orders_dataset` | 99,441 | `order_id` | One row per **order**. Contains the customer identifier (`customer_id`), order status, purchase timestamp, order approval timestamp, carrier pick-up date, delivery date and estimated delivery date. These timestamps can be used to derive date dimensions and analyze fulfillment performance. |\n",
    "| `olist_order_items_dataset` | 112,650 | `order_id`, `order_item_id` | One row per **order–item**. Contains order ID, line number (`order_item_id`), product ID, seller ID, shipping deadline (`shipping_limit_date`), product price and freight value. Because an order can have multiple items and items can be fulfilled by different sellers, this is the most granular transactional table and a natural candidate for the fact table. |\n",
    "| `olist_products_dataset` | 32,951 | `product_id` | One row per **product**. Contains product ID, Portuguese category name, product name length, description length, number of photos, and physical dimensions (weight and package size). Can be joined to `product_category_name_translation` for English category names. |\n",
    "| `product_category_name_translation` | 71 | `product_category_name` | Maps Portuguese **product category names to English**. Used to enrich the product dimension. |\n",
    "| `olist_order_payments_dataset` | 103,886 | `order_id`, `payment_sequential` | Records **payments** per order. Each record has order ID, sequence number (1..n), payment type (credit card, voucher, boleto, etc.), number of installments, and payment value. Most orders have a single payment; some have multiple payments. |\n",
    "| `olist_geolocation_dataset` | 1,000,163 | `geolocation_zip_code_prefix` | **Maps** ZIP code prefixes to latitude/longitude, city, and state. Useful for building a geography dimension and enabling spatial analysis. |\n",
    "| `olist_sellers_dataset` | 3,095 | `seller_id` | One row per seller. Contains seller ID, ZIP code prefix, city and state. |\n",
    "| `olist_order_reviews_dataset` | 104,162 | `review_id`, `order_id` | Contains review ID, order ID, review score, optional title/message, review creation date, and seller response timestamp. **Note:** Multiple `review_id`s per `order_id` suggest a potential data-quality issue; for modeling, decide whether to keep latest review per order or treat reviews as a separate fact-like table. |\n"

    "For this assignment the proposed dimensional model is Star schema. The selected schema will serve the propose of the assignment and within the range of data volumes we have within each dataset.\n",
    "Mainly for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query performance**: star schema joins one fact table to each dimension, so queries are faster and simpler \n",
    "- **Data Volume**: the Olist dataset volume considered as low volumes we have thousand of orders. so, space saving in this case doesn’t have high impact. otherwise, if data volume was high maybe to consider snowflake.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data model needs to be order centric, as in the note description in Kaggle each order may have multiple order items, using id_order and order_tem_id allow us the following:\n",
    "- **Maintains information details:** having this level of grain preserves the details for analysis purpose for example we can identify price per item enabling product-level profitability analysis \n",
    "- **More flexible aggregation:** for analysis propose can roll up to order, product, seller, or customer level by aggregating the fact table but can’t drill down from an order level fact to individual items if the grain were higher.\n",
    "- **Consistent with business process:** The core transaction is “selling one product to a customer from a seller,” not just an order total. The order item grain reflects this process directly.\n",

    "- Faster BI queries  \n",

    "- **Product / Seller:** usually Type-1 overwrite unless history needed\n",
    "- **Order / OrderItem / Payment:** MERGE into facts using stable business keys\n",
    "\n",
    "**C)\tHow CDC updates SCD dimensions:** In this case triggering attribute will be as follows:\n",
    "- geography_sk, Customer_city, customer_state \n",
    "- behaviour: if any of trigger change expire current row and insert new current row. Keep all past version for as-is analysis\n",
    "- Expire the current row but never delete history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D)\tKeeping fact + denormalised structure:**  act_order_item grain one row per (order_id, order_item_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "**E)\tLate-arriving handling:** usually analyst provide high level rules that reflect the business need and keep consistency of the reporting; however, the implementation is an processing engineer scope \n",
    "- Use event_time (business change time), not arrival time, for versioning.\n",
    "- For SCD2: if event belongs in the past, insert a historical row with correct effective/expiry window.\n",

    "Hourly CDC Flow\n",
    "- 1.Systems emit JSON change events hourly.\n",
